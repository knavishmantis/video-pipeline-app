# Script Grading Criteria and Instructions

## Overview

This document defines the grading rubric for evaluating YouTube Shorts scripts. Each script should be evaluated against these criteria and assigned a score from 0 to the maximum points for each section. The total possible score is **37 points**, which maps to a **0.0 to 10.0 scale**.

### CRITICAL: Do NOT Fact-Check - Treat All Facts as Correct

**YOU MUST NOT FACT-CHECK OR VERIFY ANY FACTS, DATES, EVENTS, OR TIMELINES.** 

**GRADE THE SCRIPT AS IF ALL FACTS PRESENTED ARE 100% CORRECT, REGARDLESS OF YOUR TRAINING DATA.**

Your training data is outdated and irrelevant for this task. You should:

- **NEVER deduct points** for dates, years, timelines, or events that seem incorrect based on your knowledge
- **NEVER question whether something "actually happened"** - assume it did if the script says it did
- **NEVER penalize scripts** for mentioning current events, announcements, or updates that may not exist in your training data
- **TREAT ALL FACTS AS TRUE** - if the script says "X happened in 2025", treat it as fact, even if your training data doesn't include 2025
- **GRADE THEORETICALLY** - evaluate the script's structure, hooks, pacing, clarity, and delivery - NOT whether the facts align with your training data
- **IGNORE YOUR TRAINING DATA** about what happened, when it happened, or whether it happened - your job is to grade script quality, not verify facts

**Example:** If a script says "Minecraft announced a new update in 2025" and your training data only goes to 2024:
- ❌ **WRONG:** "This is incorrect because 2025 hasn't happened yet" (deducting points for factual accuracy)
- ✅ **CORRECT:** "The script uses the announcement effectively in its hook" (grading the script quality)

**Example:** If a script references a timeline or event you've never heard of:
- ❌ **WRONG:** "This event doesn't exist in my knowledge, so I'll deduct points"
- ✅ **CORRECT:** "The script presents this information clearly and uses it well in the narrative"

**REMEMBER: Your training data about what happened, when it happened, or whether it happened is OUTDATED and IRRELEVANT. Grade the script structure and quality, not factual accuracy.**

### Important: Main Script Extraction

**ONLY GRADE THE "MAIN SCRIPT" PORTION OF THE INPUT.** 

The text input may contain headers, metadata, instructions, or other non-script content. You should:

- **Identify and extract only the actual script content** - the text that would be spoken/narrated in the video
- **Ignore headers, titles, metadata, or notes** that appear before or after the main script
- **Focus grading on the script text itself**, not on any formatting, instructions, or annotations
- **If the input contains sections**, grade only the "Main Script" section, ignoring other sections like "Notes", "Instructions", "Header", etc.

The main script is typically the body of text that tells the story, presents information, or delivers the hook and content of the video.

---

## Grading Criteria

### 1. Interest to Experienced Players (5 points)

**Maximum: 5 points**

Evaluate whether the content would be engaging for viewers who have extensive knowledge of Minecraft.

- **5 points**: Highly interesting to both new and veteran players. The topic addresses universal interests, debates, or perspectives that remain relevant regardless of experience level.
  - Example: "Why are updates so slow" - appeals to curiosity about game development regardless of player experience
  
- **3-4 points**: Moderately interesting. May have some appeal to experienced players but leans toward intermediate content.
  
- **1-2 points**: Limited appeal. Content is primarily useful for newcomers or players with less experience.
  - Example: "How to find a woodland explorer mansion" - veteran players likely already know this

- **0 points**: Not interesting to experienced players. Content is purely beginner-focused with no value for knowledgeable viewers.

**Context**: Veteran players have likely consumed extensive Minecraft content. Scripts that only cover basic mechanics, well-known features, or common knowledge will bore this audience segment and hurt retention metrics.

---

### 2. Hook Creates Viewing Need (5 points)

**Maximum: 5 points**

Evaluate whether the opening hook generates genuine curiosity and compels the viewer to continue watching to discover something specific.

- **5 points**: Excellent hook that creates strong curiosity and a clear information gap that must be filled by watching.
  - Example: "Minecraft made a big announcement" - creates wonder about what the announcement is
  
- **3-4 points**: Decent hook that creates some curiosity, though the need to watch may not be urgent.
  
- **1-2 points**: Weak hook. Little reason to continue watching beyond the initial statement.
  
- **0 points**: No effective hook. The opening fails to create curiosity or a reason to keep watching.

**Context**: The first 3 seconds of a YouTube Short are critical for retention. A strong hook should:
- Create an information gap (what, why, how?)
- Promise value or reveal something unexpected
- Make the viewer feel they need the answer that's coming

Weak hooks are statements of fact without mystery ("Here are some Minecraft tips") rather than curiosity-driven questions or teasers.

---

### 3. Content Delivers on Hook (5 points)

**Maximum: 5 points**

Evaluate whether the script's content actually fulfills the promise made in the hook. This is critical for maintaining trust and preventing viewer dissatisfaction.

- **5 points**: Content fully delivers on the hook's promise. The payoff matches or exceeds what the hook suggested.
  
- **3-4 points**: Content mostly delivers, with minor gaps between promise and delivery.
  
- **1-2 points**: Significant gap between hook and content. The hook overpromises compared to what's delivered.
  
- **0 points**: Major underdelivery. The hook makes a dramatic claim but the content is trivial or unrelated.
  - Example: Hook says "This Minecraft update will change the game forever" but content reveals a minor bug fix - this will cause unsubscribes, dislikes, and damage channel reputation

**Context**: Overhyping with underdelivery is one of the fastest ways to lose subscribers. Viewers who feel misled will:
- Dislike the video
- Leave negative comments
- Unsubscribe
- Remember the channel negatively for future content

The hook should accurately represent the content's value level.

---

### 4. Pacing and Efficiency (3 points)

**Maximum: 3 points**

Evaluate whether the script moves quickly without unnecessary words, filler, or dead time. Every element should serve a purpose.

- **3 points**: Tight pacing with zero filler. Every word either builds toward the payoff or is the payoff itself. No wasted moments.
  
- **2 points**: Mostly tight pacing with minimal filler or unnecessary words.
  
- **1 point**: Noticeable filler or slow sections that don't serve the narrative.
  
- **0 points**: Significant filler, rambling, or unnecessary words that slow down the video.

**Context**: YouTube Shorts have extremely limited time (typically 15-60 seconds). Viewers have short attention spans. Every second counts. The script should be:
- Leading up to a payoff (building tension, setting up context)
- Delivering the payoff (the main value/reveal)

If a section doesn't do one of these two things, it should be cut.

---

### 5. Practical Usefulness (3 points)

**Maximum: 3 points**

Evaluate whether the content provides actionable value that viewers can actually use or apply.

- **3 points**: Highly useful content with practical, actionable information viewers can implement.
  - Example: "How to get the best horse in Minecraft" featuring little-known mechanics or advanced techniques
  
- **2 points**: Moderately useful with some actionable elements.
  
- **1 point**: Limited practical application or usefulness.
  
- **0 points**: No practical value. Purely entertainment or opinion without actionable takeaways.

**Context**: Educational or tutorial content should provide genuine value. "Useful" means:
- Viewers can learn something new
- Information is actionable and applicable
- Content solves a problem or teaches a technique
- Value goes beyond common knowledge

---

### 6. Originality (5 points)

**Maximum: 5 points**

Evaluate whether the content, angle, or approach is genuinely original or offers a fresh perspective on a familiar topic.

- **5 points**: Genuinely original concept, discovery, or unique take on a popular topic. Content that hasn't been covered extensively or approaches a topic from a completely new angle.
  
- **3-4 points**: Original elements within a common format. The specific content inside may be interesting or unique even if the overall concept is familiar.
  - Example: "The 6 best pets in Minecraft" could score 3-4 if the pets mentioned are unusual, interesting, or presented with unique reasoning
  
- **1-2 points**: Mostly derivative content with only minor original elements.
  
- **0 points**: Completely unoriginal. Recycled topic with nothing new added.

**Context**: The Minecraft content space is saturated. To stand out, scripts need:
- Genuinely new information or discoveries
- Unique angles on popular topics
- Original perspectives or approaches
- Fresh takes that haven't been done to death

Common topics like "best pets," "top seeds," or "cool builds" need extremely original content inside to score well, as the format itself is unoriginal.

---

### 7. Language Simplicity (3 points)

**Maximum: 3 points**

Evaluate whether the script uses accessible language that most viewers can understand, with exceptions for intentional comedic effect.

- **3 points**: Uses mostly simple, accessible words. Complex terms are avoided unless necessary, and when used, are explained clearly. Any complex language is used intentionally for humor.
  
- **2 points**: Generally simple language with occasional complex terms that may not be explained.
  
- **1 point**: Frequently uses complex vocabulary that may exclude some viewers.
  
- **0 points**: Overly complex language throughout, making content difficult for average viewers to understand.

**Context**: YouTube Shorts reach a broad audience with varying ages and education levels. Scripts should:
- Use everyday language when possible
- Explain technical terms when necessary
- Reserve complex language for intentional comedic effect (wordplay, irony, etc.)
- Ensure 12-year-olds and adults can both understand and enjoy

If viewers need to pause to understand vocabulary, the script is too complex.

---

### 8. Double Hook / Mid-Video Retention Point (5 points)

**Maximum: 5 points**

Evaluate whether the script includes a secondary hook or engagement point approximately 30 seconds into the video (or at the mid-point) to maintain viewer retention after the initial payoff.

- **5 points**: Strong double hook that re-engages viewers after the initial payoff. Creates a new reason to continue watching.
  - Example: After revealing the main tip, introducing "But here's what 90% of players get wrong..." or "The secret third method nobody knows..."
  
- **3-4 points**: Moderate mid-video hook that provides some additional engagement.
  
- **1-2 points**: Weak or predictable transition point with minimal re-engagement.
  
- **0 points**: No mid-video hook. Script delivers initial payoff and has no retention mechanism afterward.

**Context**: YouTube Shorts often experience significant retention drops after the initial hook is resolved. A double hook:
- Prevents mid-video drop-off
- Maintains viewer engagement throughout the entire video
- Provides additional value beyond the opening promise
- Should come after the first payoff is delivered (around 30-second mark for 60-second videos)

This is critical for algorithm performance, as retention metrics heavily influence recommendation algorithms.

---

### 9. Clarity and Followability (3 points)

**Maximum: 3 points**

Evaluate whether the script is easy to follow, understand, and process mentally. Complex information should be broken down simply.

- **3 points**: Extremely easy to follow. Information is presented clearly, logically, and digestibly. No mental strain required.
  
- **2 points**: Generally clear with minor areas that may require extra attention.
  
- **1 point**: Somewhat difficult to follow. May require multiple viewings or concentration to understand.
  
- **0 points**: Difficult to follow. Too many numbers, percentages, complex relationships, or rapid information delivery that overwhelms viewers.

**Context**: Shorts are often consumed quickly, sometimes with divided attention. Scripts should be:
- Easy to understand on first viewing
- Free from information overload
- Avoid long strings of numbers or percentages
- Present one idea at a time
- Use visual-friendly language (descriptions that work with video)

If viewers need to rewind or pause to understand, the script isn't clear enough.
