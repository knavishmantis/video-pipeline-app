## KnavishMantis Shorts Creation Pipeline

- **Scripter** creates the Clipping & Editing Guide as a PDF, with scenes, and the audio MP3 of the script
- **Clipper** takes the script and creates the in-game clips like `1.mp4`, corresponding to the first scene of text, etc.
- **Editor (This Guide)** takes the script, the clips, and the MP3 and creates the final product, with the length being determined by the premade script

## Usage of Blur to the Top and Bottom and Use the Space to Add CTA

For certain scenes, since the clips are exported in horizontal 4K format, if the scene is of a player attacking a creeper, when fit to the height of the shorts resolution (1080×1920), the content like the player or the creeper might not all be able to fit in the frame's width.

If this is the case, use this method of shrinking the screen and adding blur to the top and bottom. In cases like this, when there's now blur to the top, use that opportunity to put a CTA, usually "Subscribe" at the top. Here's an example - camman18 uses this method often:

But keep in mind that for cinematic quality it's preferred to have the entire height filled with the actual content not the placeholder blur, but at least a few scenes per short should use it in order to fit the subscribe in.

## Music

Here is a set of default music choices for the shorts: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FBy2h15szTlNJA8UfDyKMXT23qr4brpx?usp=sharing - use them accordingly based on which music matches the pace and vibe of the short.

Feel free to use any other music you find. I'm providing those there as a default in case you don't have music you think would fit better. Also, don't be afraid to use multiple music MP3s in one short, for example transitioning from one to another if the pace of the video changes.

## Sound Effects

Added sound effects are encouraged. There is a preference for Minecraft native sounds when applicable. For example, if there's a dog on screen and they're mentioned, have a Minecraft dog bark sound. For villagers, have the "Hrr" sound.

## Usage of AI Tool to Highlight Content

Most editors will have the AI tool of highlighting an object inside the video. This is useful for when the audio is talking about something - highlight the object in the scene as it's mentioned is a good way to get the audience engaged.

In this example, the audio was, *"because they were just innocently flying between pillars when the player arrived, and Notch"*, with the highlight of Notch happening as the audio is over "Notch".

## Adding Subtitles

Since the script will be provided to you, ensure that the subtitles are actually correct. You can use AI to generate the subtitles but make sure to double check with the script.

When adding subtitles, make sure that they will be readable on all devices. Sometimes when the subtitles are near the edges of the frame, on a phone they clip at the edges.

## CTA at the End of the Video

Always have a subscribe CTA at the end. Use these ones to maintain style across the shorts. (Note: these might have a render artifact at the end - watch out for that and remove it if it's there)
